# Hupfeld-Leipzig Branch
The Hupfeld-Leipzig branch of the Indigo Upright Piano, is a recording of a diffrent piano entirely, but still out of tune, giving it a simmilar sound.
The colour piano soundfonts work on descriptions, so more pianos might be used for 1 soundfont.

This piano has not yet been recorded, the recording is scheduled for 21.6. as I am home alone and can record in peace.

This soundfont (will) Includes : 

 - 29 samples (A, C, D#, F#)
 - 3 versions to choose from

          > Regular
          > Realistic Reverb
          > Clean

 - infinite vol env release for higher keys


This soundfont will not have vel. layers unless added by user
